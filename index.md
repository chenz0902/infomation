## Previous jobs that might be relevant
Research positions as above: <br />
-2013-2014 Student Research Assistant at KTH Department of Transport Science <br /> 
-2017 until now responsible for a research project on <a href="http://gaming.sth.kth.se/Mobility/" target="_blank">sustainable campus</a> in universities and using computational methods in close cooperation with Department of Production Engineering, for increasing the attractiveness of education and mobilization in suburban Stockholm areas. More thant 200 employees and students have been surveyed. Obs! the server is in maintenance due to safety issues and so the accessbility might be limited<br />
